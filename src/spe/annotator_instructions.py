      # Simple English
      f'"Expert": Person with high knowledge, such as a university professor.\n' 
      #f'Example for "Expert": "It looks depressing, says Peter Jensen, who is a professor at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU.". In this example "Peter Jensen" is an "Expert". '
      f'"Case": Person with telling about personal experiences.\n'
      #f'Example for "Case": "Michael, who is a family man, was not happy with the cuts at the institutions.". Here "Michael" would be the "Case" DR selected to interview. A hypothetical mentioned "hobbyist" talking about his LEGO collection could also be an example of "Case". '
      f'"Politician": Person working in politics.\n'
      #f'Example for "Politician": "Foreign Minister Jakob Ellemann-Jensen decided to visit NATO". In this example "Jakob Ellemann-Jensen" is a "Politician". '
      f'"DR source": Person directly associated with DR, such as DR employees or correspondents.\n'
      #f'Example for "DR source": "I could use another cars, says Holger Sandberg...". If there are no other references of who "Holger Sandberg" is or who he works for, then "Holger Sandberg" is likely a DR source. If "Holger" is a "DR korrespondent", then there is no doubt "Holger" is a "DR source". '
      f'"Interest organization": Organizations like working unions or business associations.\n'
      #f'Example for "Interest organization": Could e.g. trade unions like "DJÃ˜F" or "Dansk Industri". '
      f'"Professional expert": Person with high professional/industry knowledge.\n'
      #f'Example for "Professional expert": "It is problematic, says Mogens Fabricius, who is technical advisor at COWI". In this example "Mogen Fabricius" is a "Professional expert". ' 
      f'"Authority": Official bodies or institutions like the police or health authority.\n'
      #f'Example for "Authority": "Danish Tax Ministry" and "Police" are good examples. '
      f'"Other": Use this category when none of the other categories apply.\n'
      #f'Example for "Other": This type MUST be used if no other function type is suitable. '
